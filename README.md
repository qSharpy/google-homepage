[Project start]

This project is about making a web page look as close as possible to the Google homepage
using basic html/css.

From The Odin Project's [Curriculum]
http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css

[Update]

Project finished, 5h total to develop. The result is an almost analog website to Google.com homepage.
 
Didn't rely on any Developer Tools and didn't view the homepage's source code, as instructed.


With further developing, it is easy to make this a potential phishing page.

Had fun.
